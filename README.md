# Hi, I'm Joaquin 👋

My professional work revolves around designing clean contracts, plugin-based architectures, and developer-friendly SDKs, while I spend a fair amount of time exploring low-level security and exploitation to better understand how systems really behave.

## Currently

- By day: building frontend as a platform, architectures, SDKs, plugin systems, and long-lived extensible foundations  
- By night: low-level security research, exploitation, reverse engineering, memory safety, and execution boundaries, driven by small, focused experiments

## Philosophy

- Architecture is about constraints, not features.
- Good APIs reduce the need for documentation.
- If something feels complex, it probably is.
- Curiosity beats cleverness.

## Interests

- Low-level programming and system behavior
- Software security and exploitation
- Architecture at different layers of the stack
- Stable systems built to age well
- Exploring the edges where systems start to fall apart

Feel free to look around or reach out if something here resonates.
